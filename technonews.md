# Some apps and what they do good.

1. InShorts : 

when on-line:

- make the user get used to up swipes in the starting page.
- minimal ui with three screens and major focus on a single page.
- category selection will change the main focus content.
- loading page can has some good flat design yet simple enough to understand.
- easy access to bookmarks and stuff that is relevant to the user.
- notifications for the stories remaining and if new stories have been loaded
- play any video if linked in the article. and minimal intuitive to close.if link isn't recognized open the link using in-app browser.
- quick notifications for news updates
- Settings : a night mode to go easy on eyes, turn off notifications, switch off HD images, langauge.
- Quick UI : share it with friends using phone number and facebook integration, book mark it.
- suggestions on topics.
- search functionality
- no login to spare the user from hazel of setting up an account
- remembers position of the article when closed or minimized

when off-line:

- no major change in ui , no bad indication. on refreshing  shows a small popup saying "unable to fetch latest stories"
- going to the in-app browser shows a nice little page saying "No internet connection", has a button to go back.


things that you thing would have made sense:

- when navigated to bookmarks if the page is blank we need to go back to the options menu to get the feed.we could have had direct access from the bookmarks empty page itself.

when on-line:

- Nice login page with a moving background and color theme and a big tag line.
- Sign-in and get started page takes you to the sign-in landing page
- Pick topic/s to follow , shows a nice progress bar UI to indicate you've selected sufficient amount of topics.

- first page has a large image that has the special article/ more famous article. and two small paragraphs to show other famous articles. they have drop downs to let you upvote / downvote a post, which will finetune your later experience
- A single flipboard has an image. a top bar showing from which **category** it is. share and like options.

- Ads integration is done in one filpbaord. dedicated to a ad. category is shown as promoted.
- The layout changes by the amount of matter and especially with the image size.

- all topics are placed in a tab to review and edit.
- connecting social accounts and a profile page that has all your magazines.
