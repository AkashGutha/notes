- Idea : the most important and hardest one. no point in coming up with an idea that is already flooded with lot of people. if you find any find any other competitor already in the market and research and gather information.
then reconsider what you've got and decide whether your ide is a good fit,.
making this decision should be quick and efficient.

- Product fit : mocking up your system. look and feel, getting feedback iterating your design and prototyping.
always do multiple mockups so that you get good results. (www.moqups.com && adobe XD). go to some relevant audience and show your app get feedback.
Look at other competitors and get good details on their design and branding and how they did things. 
always do your revenue model come back and if ads are a part integrate them into the design subtle

- _it should be a minimal viable product so that you don't get overwhelmed all features you wanna include_

-  Build : always look for professional teams. that's it end of game. never do a one man band.
always do a minimum viable product. 

- Market fit : prove your market fit

    1. Full app purchase  ( rule this out totally )

        - for merchants the value paid for the service is important
    3. Outside app depending on the app.

    - build ads into the design they should be subtle
